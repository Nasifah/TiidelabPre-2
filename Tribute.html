     A man of the people he was called during his lifetime. He was a great icon who was always concerned about the masses, especially children, from the moment he was old enough to differentiate between right and wrong. Due to his human right activism, he was imprisoned for a good number of 27 years but that didn't stop his mission of getting rid of tyrants in his country. He never had a bit of love for people who discriminated against skin color. The great man fought injustice throughout his days even as a president when he was old and gray.He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and donated part of the prize money to children on the street. He's known across South Africa and beyond for his humanitarian devotion.
